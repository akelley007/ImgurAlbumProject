# ImgurAlbumProject
A nifty little project that uses the Imgur API to fetch Albums and Photos!

To browse albums simply enter your search query into the search bar and submit!

This Project was written in Kotlin and utilizes MVVM, LiveData, coroutines, Retrofit, Dagger2, and Jetpack Navigation Components!

I felt this design approach was appropriate because it proves a sleek and clean implementation while working with newer technologies in the industry

This project also uses two 3rd party libraries. MaterialSearchBar for the search bar widget and Glide for it's asynchronous image loading. 

I decided to include these libraries in the project because I felt the MaterialSearchBar added a fresh feel to the user expeience and Glide is a very useful tool for delegating the asynchronous image loading functionality.
