# ImgurAlbumProject
A nifty little project that uses the Imgur API to fetch Albums and Photos!

This Project was written in Kotlin and utilizes MVVM, LiveData, coroutines, Retrofit, Dagger2, and Jetpack Navigation Components!

I felt this design approach was appropriate because it proves a sleek and clean implementation while working with newer technologies in the industry

This project also uses a 3rd party library for the search bar widget. I decided to include it in the project because i felt it added a fresh feel to the user expeience
